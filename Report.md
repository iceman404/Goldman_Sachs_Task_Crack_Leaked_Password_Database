## To approach this task and deliver a thorough assessment, I will break down the process into actionable steps:

## 1. Identify the Hashing Algorithm
**The first step is identifying the hashing algorithms used to protect these passwords. We can do this by examining the characteristics of the hashes.**

## Hashing Algorithm Breakdown:
```txt
e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e: This hash is 32 characters long, typically a result of the MD5 hashing algorithm.
25f9e794323b453885f5181f1b624d0b: This hash is also 32 characters, so it is another MD5 hash.
d8578edf8458ce06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4: This is a MD5 hash.
5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99: This is a MD5 hash (commonly known as the hash for "password").
96e79218965eb72c92a549dd5a330112: This hash is a MD5 hash.
25d55ad283aa400af464c76d713c07ad: This is also an MD5 hash.
e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03: MD5 hash.
fcea920f7412b5da7be0cf42b8c93759: MD5 hash.

3f230640b78d7e71ac5514e57935eb69: MD5 hash.
917eb5e9d6d6bca820922a0c6f7cc28b: MD5 hash.
f6a0cb102c62879d397b12b62c092c06: MD5 hash.

1f5c5683982d7c3814d4d9e6d749b21e: MD5 hash.
8d763385e0476ae208f21bc63956f748: MD5 hash.
defebde7b6ab6f24d5824682a16c3ae4: MD5 hash.
bdda5f03128bcbdfa78d8934529048cf: MD5 hash.
Conclusion: All the hashes listed are MD5 hashes, which are considered insecure due to their
susceptibility to collision attacks and speed, making them easier to crack.
```

## 2. Level of Protection Offered by the Mechanism
**MD5, being a fast and widely known hashing algorithm, offers very weak protection for password storage. 
It is not recommended for password hashing in modern systems due to the following:**

## Speed: MD5 hashes can be cracked extremely quickly with modern hardware (especially GPUs).
## Vulnerabilities: MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks, where two different inputs can result in the same hash, allowing attackers to bypass controls.
## Pre-computed Rainbow Tables: MD5 is subject to precomputed rainbow tables, making it easy for attackers to look up hash values and obtain the original password.
## Overall protection level: Low.

## 3. Controls to Implement for Harder Cracking
**To make cracking more difficult, the organization should consider implementing the following controls:**

**Use Stronger Hashing Algorithms: Switch to stronger, more secure algorithms like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2, which are 
designed to be slow, computationally expensive, and resistant to brute force.**

**Salted Hashing: Ensure that each password is salted before hashing. A salt is a random value added to the password before hashing, 
making rainbow table attacks much harder.**

**Key Stretching: Use key stretching techniques, where the hash function is applied multiple 
times to increase the processing time and difficulty for attackers.**

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Add an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide another 
form of verification, such as a code sent to their phone or email.**

**Password Hashing Iterations: Use algorithms that apply multiple iterations of hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) to make brute-force attacks exponentially harder.**

## 4. Assessment of the Organization’s Password Policy.
**Based on the hashes, we can infer some aspects of the organization's password policy:**

## Password Length: All passwords appear to be relatively short, with many around 6–8 characters.
**Low Entropy: Several of the hashes represent common or easily guessable passwords like “password” or “123456”. 
This indicates that the keyspace is likely too small and does not encourage strong password creation.**

**Repetitive Passwords: There are obvious patterns in some of the passwords, such as “simmson56” or “bandalls”, 
which suggests the policy might not be enforcing diversity in password selection.**

**Conclusion: The password policy likely encourages weak, easily guessable passwords, which leads to low overall security.**

## 5. Suggested Changes in the Password Policy
## To make breaking the passwords harder, the organization should consider the following changes to their password policy:

## Minimum Length: Require passwords to be at least 12–16 characters long to increase the keyspace.
```text
Complexity Requirements: Enforce complexity rules, such as requiring a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Prohibit Common Passwords: Use a list of known common passwords (like “password”, “123456”, etc.) and disallow them.
Password Expiration and Rotation: Implement policies for password expiration every 60–90 days, with users unable to reuse their previous passwords.
Password Blacklist: Maintain a blacklist of common or compromised passwords to prevent users from using easily guessable or stolen credentials.
Encourage Passphrases: Suggest or require the use of passphrases (e.g., "blueTiger@1234") to ensure both length and complexity.
```
